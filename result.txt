A dying man with art to soothe,A paragon of virtue he!And physic bring with mournful face,Beneath his head the pillow smooth,But what a nuisance it will be,Chained to his bedside night and dayHe hath acquired the world's esteemIf seriously he hath disease;My uncle's goodness is extreme,My uncle's goodness is extreme,To sigh and meditate alone:When will the devil take his own!Without a chance to slip away.Ye need dissimulation base

My uncle's goodness is extreme,Mf seriously he hath disease;My uncle's goodness is extreme,Mnd nothing more important sees;M paragon of virtue he!Mut what a nuisance it will be,Mhained to his bedside night and dayMithout a chance to slip away.Me need dissimulation baseM dying man with art to soothe,Meneath his head the pillow smooth,Mnd physic bring with mournful face,Mo sigh and meditate alone:Mhen will the devil take his own!
